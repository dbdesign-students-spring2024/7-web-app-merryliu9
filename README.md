This is an app that acts like a forum for students or anyone to post their suggestions on how to improve the college. For instance, students could make comment on their suggestion to improve dining hall's food. Users could choose to vote on whther they agree with the posted suggestion or not. There is also an administrator who could track the progress of the suggestion by logging in as an administrator.
